NLP with Python with Cognitive database
Script to check what can be done using NLP.

Using the Alzheimer's project database.
There are 4 cognitive status cases (normal, impaired not MCI, MCI, dementia). 
I predict the cognitive status by using number of words in the descriptions and also apply a NLP approach that examines the vocabulary using the TF-IDF metric
